       <p>Jones looks to defend his title against the greatest Heavy Weight of All Time Stipe Miocic. By beating Miocic thus would cement Jones his legacy as the greatest fighter of all time. The man looking to forte that plan and regain his belt however is Stipe Miocic. Who, as we all know is regarded as the greatest of all time. <p>

      <h3>Main Event</h3>
      <p>
        Now time for a breakdown for the Main Event of the Evening. As stated before Jones is looking to cement his legacy as the greatest of all time. His ability to read and deceive fighters is unlike any other fighter we have ever seen. Competing in the UFC since Jones was only 19 Jones quickly rows to fame becoming the youngest UFC Champion ever at just 21 years old. He has the most title fights in UFC history (16).Although he has a very troubled past he still remains the fan favorite and favorite for the fight. <p>

<p>The man looking to take John down and show the world he still got it is Stipe Miocic. Know for his beautiful striking, amazing resilin's, and impressive grappling. He took a 2 year break off from the sport after losing to Francis Ngannu by scary knockout. Stipe is ready to step back into the ring in order to prove he still is the king of the heavy weight division. <p>

Will Jones be able to complete is conquest and show everyone why he is considered the G.O.A.T ? or will Stipe come back for his belt with a vengeance. Showing age is only a number ? Tune in November 16th, 2024 to find out.<p>
